# Image-Classifier using TensorFlow on "Oxford of 102 flower" Dataset
Image classifier using tensorflow transferlearning, Machine Learning Nanodegree, Udacity

In this project, I trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. I trained this classifier, then exported it for use in my application. I used this dataset from Oxford of 102 flower categories.

The project is broken down into multiple steps:

Loading the image dataset and create a pipeline.
Building and Training an image classifier on this dataset.
Using the trained model to perform inference on flower images.

**Note:** Dataset needs to be downloaded locally to run model.
