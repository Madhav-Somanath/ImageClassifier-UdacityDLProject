# Image-Classifier using TensorFlow on "Oxford of 102 flower" Dataset
Image classifier using tensorflow transferlearning, Introduction to Machine learning using Tensorflow Nanodegree, Udacity

This project includes training an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. This classifier is then exported it for use in a cli application. Dataset is taken from : https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/

The project is broken down into multiple steps:

1. Loading the image dataset and create a pipeline.
2. Building and Training an image classifier on this dataset.
3. Using the trained model to perform inference on flower images.

Note: Dataset needs to be downloaded locally to run model.
